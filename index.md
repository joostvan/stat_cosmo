# Joost's Updates on 499
This is a beginning accumulation of new things I am excited to learn about & share about during my research with Dr. Ravi Sheth. It can be broadly separated in the following categories:

```
- Theory
- Code
- Results

# Theory
## Cosmology I: Formation
### Structure Formation
Our universe has some fascinating properties behind it. 
In cosmology, structures originate due to pertubations in a homogenous and isotropic (=same everywhere) universe. Perturbations grow due to if they are heavier than a mass or scale a la the Jean's length, at which gravity is no longer able to overcome pressure differences.

After the Big Bang, the universe had a large scale structure with overdensities of matter. These overdensities started to coalesce, forming sheets, then filaments, then haloes. Some of these haloes formed early galaxies, and some of these haloes collapsed under their own mass. In this process, they virialize. 

Most early models assume the Universe had two energy components: ordinary baryonic matter and radiation (photons from the cosmic microwave background radiation) and relativistic neutrinos. Two approaches to perturbations are involved: one is adiabatic and one is isothermal initial conditions. Adiabitic refers to having all matter and radiation fields being perturbed such that the total density varies, but the ratio of photons-baryons is the same throughout space. Isothermal refers to pertubations in the initial ratio of baryons-components but with no spatial variation w.r.t to the photons-baryons. In simple models, however, inflation, due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field, predicts adiabatic perturbations and a Gaussian initial density field.

### Nonlinear evolution
In 1970, Zel'dovich gave an analytical approximation to describe the initial non-linear collapse of a perturbation of a cosmic density field. This is to piece the dots why we have nonlinear strucutres today due to initial perturbations. In 1972, Gunn & Gott showed a simple spherically symmetric model to show the growth, turn-around, collapse, and virialization of a perturbation.
When a halo collapses, it is also likely to gain angular momentum from the tidal torques of neighboring haloes. These torques appera through gravitational torques as pancakes but also oblique shocks generated by their own collapse.
How this shape deforms is structured by the following equation:
$p(r,t)=/frac{P_o(t)}{(1-b(t)/lambda_1(q)(1-b(t)/lambda_2(q)(1-b(t)/lambda_3(q)}$

### Maximal Inequalities

### Code
Gadget-2 is software developed by Volker Springel at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. To set it up requires the following:

Along the way, I had trouble with the following errors. After being exposed to bash commands through my summer internship, setting up the right compilers and editing the paths proved a challenge and I learned how to work with Fortran/C++ based simulations. The next hurdle was establishing N-GenIC which required similar troubleshooting with the common error, for example, of "dr.fftw_mpi.h", which could be fixed after ensuring that FFTW has been re-downloaded, but more importantly, set up properly, by specifying the compiler such as clang or GNN.
