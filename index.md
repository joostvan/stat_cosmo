## Joost's Updates on 499
This is an accumulation of new things I am excited to learn about & share about during my research with Dr. Ravi Sheth. It can be broadly separated in the following categories:

```
- Theory
- Code
- Results
```
### Theory
Our universe has some fascinating properties behind it! 
- 5 Padwanaban Properties

### Code
Gadget-2 is software developed by Volker Springel at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. To set it up requires the following:

Along the way, I had trouble with the following errors. After being exposed to bash commands through my summer internship, setting up the right compilers and editing the paths proved a challenge and I learned how to work with Fortran/C++ based simulations. The next hurdle was establishing N-GenIC which required similar troubleshooting with the common error, for example, of "dr.fftw_mpi.h", which could be fixed after ensuring that FFTW has been re-downloaded, but more importantly, set up properly, by specifying the compiler such as clang or GNN.
