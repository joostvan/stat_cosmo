## Joost's Updates on 499
This is a beginning accumulation of new things I am excited to learn about & share about during my research with Dr. Ravi Sheth. It can be broadly separated in the following categories:

```
- Theory
- Code
- Results
```
### Theory
## Cosmology
Our universe has some fascinating properties behind it! 
In cosmology, structures originate due to pertubations in a homogenous and isotropic universe. Perturbations grow due to if they are heavier than a mass or scale such as a Jean's length, at which gravity is no longer able to overcome pressure differences.

After the Big Bang, the universe had a large scale structure with overdensities of matter. These overdensities started to coalesce, forming sheets, then filaments, then haloes. Some of these haloes formed early galaxies, and some of these haloes collapsed under their own mass. In this process, they virialize.

### Code
Gadget-2 is software developed by Volker Springel at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany. To set it up requires the following:

Along the way, I had trouble with the following errors. After being exposed to bash commands through my summer internship, setting up the right compilers and editing the paths proved a challenge and I learned how to work with Fortran/C++ based simulations. The next hurdle was establishing N-GenIC which required similar troubleshooting with the common error, for example, of "dr.fftw_mpi.h", which could be fixed after ensuring that FFTW has been re-downloaded, but more importantly, set up properly, by specifying the compiler such as clang or GNN.
